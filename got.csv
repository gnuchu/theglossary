Fat Larry Syndrome,A painful condition characterised by the offering of overly long and tedious justifications of how blunders of Fat Larry (qv) proportions actually weren't,Boab,Ramsay's justification that a pitta bread stuffed with falafel could also be referred to as a falafel was nothing more than another case of Fat Larry Syndrome.
BOON,"1. Beer out of Nose; a more acceptable form of COON (qv) for the itinerant PM with no place to call home, and who is therefore reduced to sitting in bars pretending to work. 2) A Manc lad with a dodgy haircut who was "cool as f*ck", played the organ and fired a non-entity called Noel Gallagher from his band.",Andy,BOON !

TOON,Tea Out Of Nose (abbrev). A spontaneous and hysterical reaction to an unusually funny post (i.e. unlikely to be one of Andy's).,Andy,Leigh's suggestion that Everton might make the knock-out stages of the Champions Leage provided a welcome TOON moment

Fat Larry,"Quantification of substantive error. Originated in the widely held but erroneous view that Boab had misattributed soul anthem 'Zoom' to The Commodores rather than Fat Larry's Band. Few realised that Boab was referring to the Commodores hit of the same name, available on almost any Commodores hits collection. Why, they were playing it in Smiths just the other day.

Mick Hucknall,See Morrissey,,http://www.mickhucknall.com/
Gig Review,"Inordinately long post detailing the insignificant minutiae relating to activities surrounding a visit to a live musical performance.  Under no circumstances should  any mention be made of the actual band or performance. Incidental observations such as the bouncer's choice of footware, or the state of the tiling in the ladies' rest room should be discussed instead.",All,"Gig Review: Hairy Dirtbox at The Kaplinsky Stadium.

Blind Alabamans,"Whilst they do not actually exist, the Blind Alabamans are indicative of a new low (qv) in dismal 'world music'. Promoted by Gil (qv) as superb (qv)",Andy,Scott - do you ever listen to anything other than Uzbek throat-warblers or the Blind Alabamans ? Why not crack out the Ramones for a change ? You'll feel better for it.
Lucinda Williams,A famous showjumper who'll be forgotten in 12 months time,Not Andy,I have no problem with show jumping per se. So long as we're talking hairy sweary Harvey Smith type stuff. But Ramsey's obsession with this Lucinda Williams nonsense beggars belief.
